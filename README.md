# Prueba_devops

1. create a microservice in python with the flask framework, following the indications of the exercise, defining the /DevOps endpoint.

A verification of the API key is added, the json is verified to be valid and the response of the microservice is defined.

2. I create the container with a Dockerfile, installing the corresponding dependencies.
3. I uploaded the docker image to docker hub.
3. locally I implemented minikube to deploy the application, adding service, ports, and autoscaling in the pods.
4. implemented a pipeline with different stages defining branches, and environments in which it is deployed.
